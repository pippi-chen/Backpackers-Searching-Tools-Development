# Backpackers-Searching-Tools-Development
Created an app in R exclusively for backpackers to satisfy basic travel needs, including available free wifi, charging stations, lockers, attractions, activities, and restaurants. I collected instant information by utilizing web crawler skills; combined information and displayed via map to guide backpackers through exerting Shiny in R.
